; ## fuzzy subsethood
; "Given two sets (which may be crisp sets), the degree to which the first is a subset of the latter."
; Use to create weighted graphs, probability distributions, ...? 

; ## fuzzy mutual entropy
; I have no idea what this is, but relative entropy is great. See "Data Science in Clojure", Edmund Jackson. He uses 
; the relative entropy among a few probability distributions to demonstrate how to detect something you don't know
; you're looking for.
