; *data-readers*
; var
; 
; Map from reader tag symbols to data reader Vars.
; 
; When Clojure starts, it searches for files named 'data_readers.clj'
; at the root of the classpath. Each such file must contain a literal
; map of symbols, like this:
; 
;     {foo/bar my.project.foo/bar
;      foo/baz my.project/baz}
; 
; The first symbol in each pair is a tag that will be recognized by
; the Clojure reader. The second symbol in the pair is the
; fully-qualified name of a Var which will be invoked by the reader to
; parse the form following the tag. For example, given the
; data_readers.clj file above, the Clojure reader would parse this
; form:
; 
;     #foo/bar [1 2 3]
; 
; by invoking the Var #'my.project.foo/bar on the vector [1 2 3]. The
; data reader function is invoked on the form AFTER it has been read
; as a normal Clojure data structure by the reader.
; 
; Reader tags without namespace qualifiers are reserved for
; Clojure. Default reader tags are defined in
; clojure.core/default-data-readers but may be overridden in
; data_readers.clj or by rebinding this Var.
