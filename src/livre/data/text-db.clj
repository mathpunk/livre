I want the book because I\n  believe in math, but I'm afraid to be a leader. I've chosen the first person\n  POV for myself because \"his book\" doesn't have the same ring. But, that means\n  that you'll have to write in character all the time in [[pm]],\n  and when it's in that file, that's how you'll know you're writing in\n  character. \n  \n  Thomas Monastic Sex Havington Price is looking for a book: The Book of The\n  Universe Containing This Book. His set is uncountably infinite, for some\n  reason, and getting bigger. It's uncountable among many dimensions, for one\n  thing. Why does he want that book? Because he doesn't want to have his\n  education forcibly removed from his head. His story is in 3POV, so that I can\n  write a simplistic story with only a few beats and a lot of special effects,\n  yet get away with it because I am also taking the time to really explain those\n  special effects that, in Thomas Henderson's opinions, really are important. \n\n# the big picture\nWe seriously live in the cyberpunk future that we were warned about.  The\niDevices, the corporate control, the collapse of news, the failed globe, the\nbillion in slums, the economic singularity drawing all money labor and\ncommodities into a heating death spiral, the surveillance in two directions,\nswarm justice and hacktivism, illegal information, cultural interpenetrative\nmarketing, the drones, the paramil police, the grey-hair minarchists, it's all\nthere. Old people frightened of young people and the sky. \n\nthe personal story\n\nThere's a generational theme that I want to get away from and have trouble\ngetting away from, and that is that someone of my age was raised with a fringe\nculture telling me, You know this is all going to fall apart right? and the\ncontrasting script telling me, Neoliberalism is here forever: technology will\nsave us, be realistic and concern yourself with small green pieces of paper, the\nimportant decisions are what to do to get money and how to dispense your money.\nWhen, in actual fact, none of these were important at all. What is important is\nthat I do not live in similar conditions to those of the men growing my coffee,\nand I don't know if by drinking coffee I am killing monkeys - well, I'm pretty\ncertain that I'm making things worse, but maybe less worse than... \n\n  I guess what I'm saying is, for someone of my particular background, middle\nclass script, pattern seeking mindset, virtual world comfortability.. it's hard\nto know what the fuck is going on. I want to know what the fuck is going on. But\nthen again, I get the sense that I have a notion of what the fuck is going on,\nand what I really want is to call into being the army of mathpunx that will be\nlike me and amplify what it is that I've been able to learn so far. \n\n  So, what I want to win is influence. What I fear to lose is my reputation, my\nidealism, and what's looming is student debt and an inability to let go of the\nbook. \n", :history [{:timestamp 1375733384000, :diff nil}]}
